            <p>
              Cuts By Us is no longer in business. This barber shop was located
              in the historic Germantown section of Philadelphia, PA. The owner
              of this barber shop needed a web site and social media management.
              He required a website that would primarily serve two purposes.
              First, the local business wanted to establish a web presence (the
              owner has been in business since 2000 and has never had a web
              site) and second, serve as a virtual help-wanted ad. I was solely
              responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the website as well as
              their social media presence and activity.

              This was a personal project. I created this application to learn
              how to use the Next.js React framework. I wanted to learn how to
              use the framework and the Tailwind CSS library. I also wanted to
              learn how to use the Fetch API to get data from an API. I used the
              Random User Generator API to get data about random users. I used
              the Chart.js library to create charts and graphs to display the
              data.

              This was a personal project. This is a .NET 8 Web API and Next.js
              UI application. This CRUD application allows users to create,
              read, update, and delete records. The application uses the Entity
              Framework Core to interact with a SQL Server database. The
              application uses the Tailwind CSS library to style the UI.

              This application was created to track the spread of the

              Fetch API to get data from an API. I used the COVID-19 API to get
